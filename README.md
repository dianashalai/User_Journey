# User Journey Analytics Dashboard

**Project Overview**
This dashboard was created to analyze user interaction stages with a product — from registration to the first payment. It provides deep insights into the conversion funnel and helps identify bottlenecks at each stage. The tool supports strategic decision-making to optimize user acquisition and retention.

**Objectives**
1. Visualize key metrics of the user journey.
2. Analyze conversion rates between stages (registration → trial → payment).
3. Offer a monitoring tool to track the average time users take to progress through each stage.

**Dashboard Features**

*Metrics:*
- Registered Users: Displays the total number of new users.
- Users Who Started a Trial: Analyzes interest in the product.
- Users Who Made a Payment: Reflects the final conversion rate.

*Visualizations:*
1. Conversion Chart:
- Displays the number of registrations and trial conversions by month.
2. User Funnel:
- Shows how many users completed each stage of the journey.
- Includes absolute (user count) and relative (conversion rate) metrics.
3. Average Transition Time Chart:
- Tracks the average number of days from registration to a specific stage.

*Interactivity:*
- Selecting a funnel stage dynamically updates the transition time chart for the corresponding stage.

*Tools Used*
Tableau: For building interactive visualizations.
CSV Data File: As the source for all metrics and visualizations.

*Business Impact*
This dashboard enables businesses to:
- Understand where users drop off along the journey.
- Analyze the effectiveness of trial periods and user acquisition strategies.
